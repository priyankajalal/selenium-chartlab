Locators:
id -> name -> linktext---> partial Linktext--->Tag name--->class name -> css -> xpath



Xapth vs cssSelector ---->
 with XPath we can search elements backward or forward in the DOM hierarchy while CSS works 
 only in a forward direction. 
 This means that with XPath we can locate a parent element using a child element
